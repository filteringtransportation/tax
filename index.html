<hr style="width:97%; margin: auto;" />
<p>These are the options of Faction Tax. As a Faction Owner, you cannot fill in a number, but you have to pick from a menu. These are the options:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.0%</li>
<li>2.5%</li>
<li>5.0%</li>
<li>7.5%</li>
<li>10.0%</li>
<li>15.0%</li>
<li>20.0%</li>
<li>25.0%</li>
<li>30.0%</li>
<li>35.0%</li>
<li>40.0%</li>
<li>45.0%</li>
<li>50.0%</li>
<li>75.0%</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to use these exact things to send a suggestion to Quinn, so he can get a DM saying that you want the taxes changed. The command works the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>ft/taxrequest [percentage]</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Lets say I want the tax at 5.0% for a bit so I can sell my concrete, then I would do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>ft/taxrequest 5.0%</em></li>
</ul>
<p>After this, you will be DMed by the bot. The first thing you send to it, will also be sent to me.</p>
<p>If I accept your request, you will again get DMed by the bot saying that I accepted it and to wait a little bit so I can change it in-game.</p>
<p>Once you are done with whatever you are doing, you can respond to the message with a "ðŸ™Œ" so I get the word that you have finished, and I can change the taxes back to default again.</p>
